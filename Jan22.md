## Risk Management Goals
 
Would signifigantly improve society if businesses adequately approximate risk management goal

Choose defensive measures to minimize:
- cost of defensive measures +
- expected losses w those defensive measures

Spending significantly less or more on defense wastes money

**Business**: lost sales, theft of intellectual property, regulatory fines, etc.

**Consumer**: unauthorized access to info held by businesses i.e. identity theft, credit card fraud, sense of invaded privacy, etc.
